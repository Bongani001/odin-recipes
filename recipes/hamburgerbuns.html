    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These hamburgers are so easy to make: light and fluffy as well as beautiful
     to look at. You will get raves whenever you make them. Try using them for 
     sandwich rolls too. <strong>Delicious!</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1(1/2) teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>5(1/2) cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1(.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 egg york</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>    
        <li><strong>Combine</strong> the milk, 1 cup of water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan.
        Bring to a boil then remove from the heat and let stand until lukewarm. If 
        the mixture is too hot, it will kill the yeast.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the flour and yeast. Pour in wet ingredients
        and stir until the dough starts to pull together. If you have a stand mixer, use
        the dough hook to mix for about 8 minutes. If not, knead the dough on a floured 
        surface for about 10 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat. 
        Cover and let stand until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Punch</strong> down the dough and divide into 12 portions They should be a little larger 
        than a golf ball. Make tight balls out of the dough by pulling the dough tightly 
        around and pinching it at the bottom. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment 
        paper or aluminum foil. After the rolls sit for a minute and relax, flatten each 
        ball with the palm of your hand until it is 3 to 4 inches wide. You may want to oil 
        your hand first. Set rolls aside until they double in size, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix together the egg yolk and 
        1 tablespoon of water in a cup or small bowl. Brush onto the tops of the rolls. 
        Position 2 oven racks so they are not too close to the top or bottom of the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong> for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the rolls from the oven and return 
        them to different shelves so each one spends a little time on the top. Continue to bake 
        for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until nicely browned on the top and bottom.</li>     
    </ol>
    <em>If you want a creamier/smoother consistency, use 1 cup heavy cream and 2 cups whole milk. The peaches 
    give a nice consistency to it, so you don't really need cream. I've used sugar substitutes but the best 
    consistency is achieved with real sugar since it lowers the freezing point of the ice cream more. Substitutes 
    often end up harder and more icy.</em>
