    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This has become one of your favorite ice creams. The rich flavor of the 
    caramelized, roasted peaches and brown sugar makes it a perfect treat on 
    a hot summer night. If you're not a big fan of cinnamon, leave that out. 
    You will find that it adds a nice depth of flavor but some may find that it overwhelms
    the subtle flavors of the peach.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large ripe peaches, halved and pitted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise (Optional)</li>
        <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Generously butter the cut portion of each peach half and place cut-side down 
        into a baking pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong> in the preheated oven until mostly cooked and bubbly, about 20 minutes. Turn 
        peaches over with a spatula and sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon into the juicy halves.</li>
        <li><strong>Cover</strong> the pan with foil and continue to bake until peaches are fully cooked and sugar 
        is mixed with butter and juices form a caramel in the pan, about 15 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, <strong>heat</strong> milk and split vanilla bean in a large pan over medium heat, stirring 
        to avoid any burning. Keep at a low simmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk</strong> together egg yolks, white sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla extract in a bowl until well 
        combined.</li>
        <li>When peaches are done, <strong>remove</strong> skins (and eat them, they're delicious!). Add peeled peaches 
        and all the caramelized juices into the hot milk. Stir to combine and simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove</strong> vanilla bean and scrape the seeds into the hot milk.</li>
        <li>Use an immersion blender to puree the peaches and the milk. Be careful as the mixture is really hot.</li>
        <li><strong>Slowly whisk</strong> 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Add more hot milk slowly to 
        temper the mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove</strong> milk from heat and allow to cool to 170 degrees F (76 degrees C). Whisk in egg yolk mixture 
        and return to low heat, whisking constantly, until a custard forms, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Strain</strong> custard through a sieve. Mixture will be really thick, so working it through with a silicone 
        spatula can take up to 10 minutes as you press and stir.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour</strong> mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions, about 20 
        minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.</li>
