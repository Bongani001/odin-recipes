    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The sweetness from the sweet potatoes is the perfect complement to the spicy chorizo inside 
    these make-ahead burritos! Store in the fridge for up to 3 days or freeze. Take one out of the freezer 
    and thaw in the fridge overnight for a quick breakfast idea!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium sweet potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package Mexican-style chorizo</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>8 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salsa</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package queso fresco, crumbled</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place sweet potatoes and green onions on the baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle 
        with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Toss to combine and spread out evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Roast</strong> in the preheated oven until soft, about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, <strong>cook</strong> chorizo in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, breaking apart with a wooden 
        spoon, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain any excess fat; transfer chorizo to a bowl and set aside to cool. Wipe 
        out the skillet and return it to the stove.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk</strong> eggs in a bowl. Heat butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in eggs and scramble 
        until just set, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape eggs into a bowl and let cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Line up</strong> tortillas in assembly-line fashion. Divide chorizo between the 8 tortillas. Top each with 
        a portion of sweet potato-onion mixture, scrambled eggs, 1 tablespoon salsa, and queso fresco. Fold the 
        bottom of each tortilla up over the filling, then fold in both sides and roll up burritos.</li>
        <li><strong>Flip</strong> burritos so they are seam side-down. Wrap each individually with aluminum foil and place into 
        a resealable plastic bag.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><em>These reheat more evenly when thawed. To reheat a thawed burrito, remove from aluminum foil and wrap 
    in a paper towel. Heat in the microwave at 30% power for 2 to 3 minutes, or until warmed through. For frozen, 
    heat at 30% power for 5 minutes, or until warmed through, turning over halfway through.</em></p>
